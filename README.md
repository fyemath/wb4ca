A concise workbook for college algebra (written in LaTeX)

This is a workbook written for a course MA119 College Algebra at QCC. The idea is to provide enough in-class practice problems. Each lesson should be suitable for a 100-minutes-long meetting with a few exceptions.

The workbook uses a domument class modified from the [elegantbook document class](https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantBook).
